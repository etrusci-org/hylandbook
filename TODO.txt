Todo & Ideas in no particular order:

- use watchdog instead of polling
- refactor stuff, expecially the export part
- export history html so one create charts (history as json embeded inside html so it can be used from the local filesystem)
- let save_dir be defined tru cli args or a txt that is in the same dir as the dist/exe
